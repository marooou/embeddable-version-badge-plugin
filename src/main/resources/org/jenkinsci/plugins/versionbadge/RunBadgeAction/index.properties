blurb=Jenkins exposes the version of the specific build as an image in a fixed URL. \
      You can put this URL into other sites (such as GitHub README) so that people \
      can see the state of the specific build. <br>There are two URLs available for inclusion: <br> \
      <ul>  \
       <li><b>protected</b> exposes the badge to users having at least 'Read' permission on the job</li> \
       <li><b>unprotected</b> exposes the badge to users having at least 'ViewStatus' permission on the job</li> \
      </ul> \
      If you want the status icons to be public readable/accessible, just grant the 'ViewStatus' permission globally to 'anonymous'.
