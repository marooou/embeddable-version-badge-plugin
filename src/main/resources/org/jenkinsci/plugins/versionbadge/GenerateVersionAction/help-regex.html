    A regular expression which will help to retrieve the version from the file. Leave blank if the version file contains only the version.
    Otherwise, the first group will be considered respectively.
    Please bear in mind that in both cases the string will be limited to 15 characters for security reasons.
    Additionally the version can be retrieved from the file path instead of the file content. In that case the regex will be applied
    on the remote file path.
